            <h1>Built an android application - TRAT MAG</h1>

            <p>TRAT MAG is an application with two main functionalities: managing employee attendance and providing access to certain parts of the app to specific users. This function provides a faster and more accurate way of managing queues and schedules to monitoring employees and tracking their attendance in both online and offline. The second part is Warehouse. This part mainly focuses on the magazine operators, who can use our application to create and manage
                inventory, bordereaux, unloading and loading. The second can also be used in offline mode without any problems.</p>
